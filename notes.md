First create the Application

    npm install --global create-react-app
    create-react-app todo-app
    cd todo-app


    npm start - serves our application on http://localhost:3000, auto-reloads on file change and lints our JavaScript code using ESLint,

    npm run build - creates a production-ready build of our application, concatenating and compressing our assets,

    npm test — runs the tests, using Jest by default,

    npm run eject — fully exposes background configurations for Webpack, Babel and ESLint, giving us full control over the tools.
